# Hello World!

Welcome to my new portfolio. I built this site to showcase my work as a **Java Full Stack Developer** and to experiment with some modern web technologies.

## The Tech Stack

I chose a stack that balances performance, developer experience, and design flexibility:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**: For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For rapid, utility-first styling.
- **Framer Motion**: To add smooth animations and interactions (like the draggable hero stack!).
- **Vercel AI SDK**: To power the "Ted Support" chatbot you see in the corner.

## Why a Chatbot?

I wanted to make the portfolio interactive. Instead of just reading about me, you can ask the chatbot specific questions about my skills or experience. It's a fun way to demonstrate my interest in AI engineering alongside traditional full-stack development.

## What's Next?

I plan to use this blog to document my learning journey, share code snippets, and write about the projects I'm working on. Stay tuned!

```java
// Here's a little Java to make it official
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
