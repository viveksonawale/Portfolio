# Understanding Pass-by-Value in Java

If you are new to Java (or returning after a gap), one of the most confusing topics is whether Java uses **pass-by-value** or **pass-by-reference**.  
You’ll hear people argue both sides. Some say Java behaves like pass-by-reference for objects. Others say Java is always pass-by-value.

The truth is simple:

> **Java is always pass-by-value.**  
> **For objects, the value being passed is the object reference.**

In this blog, we will break down exactly what that means using easy explanations and tiny examples so there’s zero confusion.

## Why this concept matters

You must understand this clearly because:

- It affects how data changes inside methods.
- It impacts debugging NullPointerExceptions.
- It helps with DSA problems involving arrays, strings, or objects.
- It forms the foundation for Spring’s bean injection and lifecycle behavior.

## 1. What does “pass-by-value” mean?

When you call a method, Java **copies** the value of the argument into the method’s parameter.

That means the method gets its **own** variable, holding a **copy** of whatever you passed.

This is true for both:

- primitive values
- object references

But the tricky part is what is being copied.

---

## 2. Primitives: Pure, simple pass-by-value

Primitive types store actual values:

- `int`
- `double`
- `boolean`
- `char`
- etc.

So when you pass them, Java copies the value directly.

### Example

```java
public class PrimitiveExample {

    static void changeValue(int x) {
        x = 100;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        changeValue(a);
        System.out.println(a); // Output: 10
    }
}
```



Her is an example on the pass by reference 

### Example

```java
class Wrapper {
    int value = 5;
}

public class Main {
    static void modify(Wrapper obj) {
        obj.value += 10;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Wrapper w = new Wrapper();
        modify(w);
        System.out.println(w.value); // Output: 15
    }
}
```
